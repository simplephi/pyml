# This is my playground with AI

Hello everyone, introduce me Ndra.
Here are some machine learning experiments that I did.
The results of these projects will form the basis for building a "Core" integrated machine learning.

## Getting Started

There are several related items, including Object Detection, Mask Detection, Natural Language Processing for e-commerce products, IBM challenge, and others.

1. [Car Price Predict](https://github.com/simplephi/pyml/tree/main/car-price-predict-flow-ibm)
2. [Mask Detection](https://github.com/simplephi/pyml/tree/main/facedetection)
3. [IBM Challenge](https://github.com/simplephi/pyml/tree/main/ibm-challenge)
4. [ML Practice](https://github.com/simplephi/pyml/tree/main/ml-practice)
5. [Product Matching](https://github.com/simplephi/pyml/tree/main/productmatching)
6. [Recommendation System (Ongoing)](https://github.com/simplephi/pyml/tree/main/recommended-system)
7. [Regression and Classification](https://github.com/simplephi/pyml/tree/main/regression-and-classification)
8. [Social Distance Detection](https://github.com/simplephi/pyml/tree/main/socialdistance)
