# Car Price Prediction

Here I use the flow model drawing using the SPSS modeler. By using this model, we can train data using the XG Boots method and also create models quickly and immediately see the results given

## Getting Started

SPSS modeler flow can run well when using IBM Watson [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson)

### Prerequisites

We using UCI Automobile Dataset


## Running the tests

How to run the automated tests for this system

### Techniques

XGBoost Tree© is an advanced implementation of a gradient boosting algorithm with a tree model as the base model. Boosting algorithms iteratively learn weak classifiers and then add them to a final strong classifier. XGBoost Tree is very flexible and provides many parameters that can be overwhelming to most users, so the XGBoost Tree node in SPSS® Modeler exposes the core features and commonly used parameters. The node is implemented in Python.
